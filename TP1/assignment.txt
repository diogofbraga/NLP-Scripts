Implement a sentence or paragraph level grep.

This tool, nlgrep, should take as argument a word or a regular
expression and filter sentences (flag -s) or paragraphs (flag -p) from
files passed as argument or from STDIN.

Examples:

    nlgrep -s input.txt > sentence_output.txt
    nlgrep -p input.txt > paragraph_output.txt
